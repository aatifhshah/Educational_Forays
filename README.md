# CriminalDatabase-PDFprofiles
Designed and implemented a database using Java that creates profiles and saves them in PDF format. 
The program implements diverse programming techniques such as Hashing, Priority Queues (Heaps), Stacks, 
and uses external JAR libraries of iText for PDF conversion. The program saves the newly created profile 
as a PDF on the hard drive and can then be used to retrieve PDFs from that location.  

I plan on adding two more functions:

1. Passing the PDFs over a network.

2. Storing the PDFs in an actual SQL database.
